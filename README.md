This is my Final Project for my Software Development 101 class at Green River College. I trimmed and cleaned the csv file to help answer the 5 focus questions I wanted to answer about the dataset. The Excel file contains the csv, a changelog recording changes made to the file, and data visualizations. The powerpoint contains my presentation, all relevant data visualizations, and the answers to the 5 questions I developed.
